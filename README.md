This repository holds the code used for Amazon's [MLU-Explain](https://mlu-explain.github.io/) educational articles on machine learning. MLU-Explain exists to illustrate core machine learning concepts using visual essays in a fun, informative, and accessible manner.

This material exists as supplementary educational material for [Machine Learning University (MLU)](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/mlu/), which provides anybody, anywhere, at any time access to the same machine learning courses used to train Amazonâ€™s own developers on machine learning.
